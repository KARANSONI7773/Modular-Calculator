## ðŸ“˜ What is Modular Programming?

**Modular Programming** means dividing a large program into small, independent files called **modules**, where each file performs a specific task.  
This makes your code:
- âœ… Easier to read  
- âœ… Easier to debug  
- âœ… Easier to maintain  
- âœ… Reusable across other projects
